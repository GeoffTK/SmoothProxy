## What?
SmoothProxy is an on-demand playlist/playback daemon for SmoothStreams, running on Android (4.0+).

## Why?
Kodi is slow, clunky, and leaves much to be desired. Better options exist, however, authentication tokens issued by SmoothStreams are only valid for 4 hours to prevent abuse of service. Traditional playlist generators requires you to manually refresh on expiration. This is not the case for SmoothProxy.

## How?
SmoothProxy generates a specialized playlist that 'points' to itself rather than SmoothStreams. When SmoothProxy receives a playback request, it determines the context of the request and responds with a 301 redirect, along with your valid authentication token, to the appropriate SmoothStreams resource. 

## Who?
Jack of all trades, master of none when it comes to programming. This is my first shot at Android development, so bare with me.

## Instructions
1. Install and launch SmoothProxy on your Android device. 
2. Fill out **[Username]**, **[Password]**, **[Service]**, and **[Server]** fields.
3. **[Save]** and/or back out of SmoothProxy. Note, **[Exit]** will terminate SmoothProxy.

4. To connect SmoothProxy with an IPTV player of your choosing, use the following URLs in verbatim:
    * Playlist URL: **http://localhost:8888/playlist.m3u8**
    * Fog's EPG URL: **http://localhost:8888/epg.xml**
5. *Enjoy!*

## Warning
At this time, SmoothProxy is barebones. It is guaranteed to break on the stupidest of reasons. If want to avoid unnecessary frustrations, refrain yourself from using SmoothProxy.

## Feedback
